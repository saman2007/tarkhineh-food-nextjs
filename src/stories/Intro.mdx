## How To Run The Project On My Local?

To initialize the database of this project, first of all [go to this route](https://github.com/saman2007/tarkhineh-food-nextjs/tree/master/src/lib/initialize)
in your cloned project. In this folder, there are all queries to create required tables of this project. Make sure to run all of the initialize table queries
to create the required tables. After you initialized required tables, create a `.env.local` in the root of the project and place the below env variables
to make the database work:

<Source
  code={`
DBHOST = #Your database host
DBPORT = #Your database port 
DBUSER = #The username of database
DBPASSWORD = #The password of your database
