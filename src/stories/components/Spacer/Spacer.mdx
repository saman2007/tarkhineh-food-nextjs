# Spacer

## About

When you have an element with `position: fixed`, it doesnt cause other elements to be rendered down of it. Elements go under it and it causes problems.
For example there is a fixed naviagtion bar in the website. Some elements will be rendered under the navigation bar and it is a bad behavior.
To solve this problem, there is a component with the name of `Spacer`.

## Props

<ArgTypes of={Spacer} />

## How To Use?

For example you have a navigation bar with `height: 180px;`. You dont want to render 180px of elements under nav bar. Just put `Spacer` component under
the nav bar and give height prop `180`. now other elements will be rendered below nav bar! See the example below:

<Source
  code={`
<>
  <nav classname="h-[180px] bg-primary">some content</nav>
  <Spacer height={180} />
</>
  `}
/>
